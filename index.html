  <header><h3>How much is it</h3></header>
  <p>I’m currently charging 30.00 per hour but I offer a sliding fee scale.  If you are on a limited budget, I can work with you.  I also offer free first consultations.  If you are outside of the Morristown area, there may be a travel fee.  This small fee helps me keep up my car and pay for gas.</p>

  <header><h3>My Experience</h3></header>
  <p>
  My experience comes from several directions.  In the US Marines, I was trained on Microsoft and Cisco systems and worked on DOD networks.  I was responsible for everything from PC repair to configuring Network routers and switches.  On leaving the Marines, I worked as a network consultant and a network administrator with local VT companies.  There I learned a wide range of systems including Sonicwall, Citrix, Linux, HP and more.  I then decided to use my GI bill and, with the help of the VA, started going to college for computer science.  There, I received a lot of training in computer programming and web programming.
