  <p>
    I am a generalist in the computing field.  I can help with PC's, Macs, and mobile devices.  I can do everything from helping you set up your email to programming a custom business application.  I do hardware maintenance and upgrades on desktop PC’s and laptops, but not on mobile devices.  I can also do custom built computers for gaming or other uses.  I mainly serve the central Vermont area and am focused around Morrisville and Stowe.  I do not carry an inventory.  Any parts that must be replaced or upgraded, I will work with you to purchase.  I also do not have a shop.  While I do work on hardware and development out of my home, my other work is done at the customer’s place of residence, business or at a location where we can meet.  Some things you may want to have me look at are:

  <a id="How"><header><h3>How much It Is</h3></header></a>
  <p>I’m currently charging $30.00 per hour but I offer a sliding scale fee.  If you are on a limited budget, I can work with you.  I also offer free first consultations.  If you are outside of the Morristown area, there may be a travel fee.  This small fee helps me keep up my car and pay for gas.</p>

  <a id="Experience"><header><h3>My Experience</h3></header></a>
  <p>
  My experience comes from several directions.  In the US Marines, I was trained on Microsoft and Cisco systems and worked on DOD networks.  I was responsible for everything from PC repair to configuring network routers and switches.  I was also certified on Microsoft systems at this point.  On leaving the Marines, I worked as a network consultant and a network administrator with local VT companies.  There I learned a wide range of systems including Sonicwall, Citrix, Linux, HP and more.  I then decided to use my GI bill and, with the help of the VA, started going to college for computer science.  There, I received a lot of training in computer programming and web programming.  In total, I have been in computing for around 13 years.
